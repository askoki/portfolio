## What I do?

<hr class="bigger-hr">

### Injury management app

I developed a web application designed to assist football medical teams in managing player injuries more effectively. It streamlines the recovery tracking and facilitates a structured return-to-play protocol, ensuring a safe and efficient rehabilitation process.

### GPS Analytics

In collaboration with conditioning coaches, I analyzed GPS data to visualize player load. This included dynamic dashboards that showcased player and team metrics, individual session insights, and weekly performance reports. By using Streamlit, I transformed boresome excel sheets into interactive visualizations, providing an intuitive and engaging user experience for data-driven decision-making.

### Data pipelines process

I have practical experience in automating the data collection and cleaning processes. My work primarily involves integrating diverse data types, including GPS, tracking, event, and performance data. While my focus has been on GPS data, I can adapt and find my way in handling a variety of data sources.

## Research

### Injury duration estimator

<img src="images/xgb_vs_expert.png?raw=true"/>

This research tackles the challenging task of predicting the recovery time after a soccer player gets injured. Instead of relying solely on a physician’s judgement, we propose an ML approach that uses extreme gradient boosting (XGB) to predict recovery time. 
We found that including the expert’s predictions as a feature in our models improved their performance. 
This research could significantly influence sports medicine by aiding teams in making informed decisions about when a player should return to play, potentially enhancing performance and minimizing the risk of further injury.

### Clustering match intensity

<img src="images/match_intensity.jpg?raw=true"/>

In our research, we delve into the unique impact of each soccer game on player performance. 
While many studies have explored various game parameters, our work stands out by examining the game on a minute-by-minute basis.
We use GPS wearable devices to create a new performance analysis framework, analyzing player energy expenditure through data analytics and K-means clustering. 
Our approach, which segments intensity into low, middle, and high periods, offers a more comprehensive explanation than traditional metrics. 
This deeper analysis can provide valuable insights for coaches and managers about player responses to different game situations.

### Building player profiles
[Building Individual Player Performance Profiles According to Pre-Game Expectations and Goal Difference in Soccer ](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/5/1700)

<img src="images/player_profiles.png?raw=true"/>

In this research, we examine how score changes and pre-game expectations can affect the effort players put in. 
Using GPS wearable sensors, we track players’ energy expenditure in 5-minute intervals, while also recording goal timings and win/lose probabilities from betting sites. 
We’ve developed a mathematical model that considers these factors to predict player effort.
The findings from this research could potentially enhance decision-making in soccer and provide a deeper understanding of individual player characteristics.
